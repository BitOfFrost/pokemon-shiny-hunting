# PokÃ©mon Shiny Hunting

> [Github Pages Link](https://bitoffrost.github.io/pokemon-shiny-hunting)

This (web) application is being developed for my shiny hunting encounters. I want to keep track of how many attempts it takes and I ended up adding the ability to track what shinies are encountered per game.

**Information:**
1. Last selected game is the first thing you reopen the page to.
2. Every hunt is saved on a per-game basis.
3. Shinies are saved in the "Shiny Log" on a per-game basis.
4. Shinies will be deleted forever from the log if the "X" Button is clicked.
5. "Reset" Button fully resets the counter
